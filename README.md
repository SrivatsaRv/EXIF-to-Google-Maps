## Short description

In the modern digital age most photos are captured on smartphones or digital cameras come equipped with GPS and automatically geotag each photo with GPS coordinates, as well as date and time of each image capture.The EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) information stored inside photo metadata can be converted into easily readable Excel Travel Log, or to visualize the same, create a Google Map of all places  ever visited.


### Problem Description

Travel enthusiasts and Independent photographers often like to map their journeys and visually recollect them when given a chance, but are unable to do so with so many pictures backed up and no means to visualize them
